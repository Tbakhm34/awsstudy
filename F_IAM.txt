IAM :
1) This service used to manage users & groups in AWS.
2) We can create roles
3) we can create custom policies.
4) policies are written in "JSON" 
================================================
What is Policy?
1) To give the permision to the users
2) policy contains below parameters
    a) effect : Allow/ Deny
    b) action : Each and every service is having list
	        of different Action. Action alway performed on
		 "Resource"
		 
		 Ex : Below are some of Ec2 service Actions
             i) RunInstances
             ii) StopInstances
             iii) TerminateInstances
             iv) AttchVolumes
             v) CraeteLoadBalancer
             vi) CreateVolume
             vii) CreateSnapshot
             etc.			 
	c) resource:  Where we can perform defined action.
	             Resource is alway menction in "ARN"
		ARN Format:
         arn:aws:service_name:regioncode:accountid: resorce
   ex : 
      1) EC2 instance ARN format , INstance is in MUmbai
         Region.
		 
		 arn:aws:ec2:ap_sounth_1:67392642:instance/i-32986349
	  2) Below is arn of "sheshi" IAM user of account 67392642

          arn:aws:iam::67392642:user/sheshi	  

	d) condition : its a optional parameter. we can write
	              condition in AWS policies.
				  
	e) Principal: 
	f) Version
    g) Statement
	
3) There are two types of policies in AWS
     a) Userbased policies: 
	    This type of policies we can assign directly 
		to IAM users within a account.
		There are two type of user based policies
		 i) AWS managed policies : This are predefined
		    policied given by AWS, We cant edit this 
			type of policies.
		 
		 ii) customer based policies: this type of
		    policies create by you, as per requirment.
			We can edit this type of policies any time.
		
	 
     b) resource based policies:	
            We can assign this type of policies 
     directly on the resource itself.		
3) policies can be assigned to users or roles.	

=========================================================
Roles:
=====
1) Roles is used allow the other account users to access
    resources in source account.
2) Roles can be assigned to EC2 instances also.

=======================================================
How to create roles to allow the another account  user to access the 
  resources in source account.

Ex :  Allow account2 user to access account1 EC2 
      resources.
Account1 Tasks:
==============
1) Create a Another AWS account role and 
   assign EC2 full permision policy to it.
Note:
 When we create "Another AWS account" access role
by default "Trusted policy" will be created.

Account2 Tasks:
================
1) Create Any "IAM" user
2) Create a custom policy to consume other account role.
 a) To consume other account resources we will use
   "sts (Secure Token Service)" service.
 b) To consume other account role we will use "AssumeRole"
   action of "STS" service.
3) Assign step2 to policy to the step1 user.
4) Login into Step1 user 
5) switch to the role.

Note : By default every thing is denied to IAM user.


Q) 
1) Create IAM user and assign Admin permision to him.
2) Create IAM user and assign read only EC2 permisions.
3) Create IAM user allow him to create new IAM users.
4) Create custom policies to allow the IAM user to 
do the admin activity between 1-mar-2017 to 31-mar-2018.
5) Write a custom policy to allow EC2 full access
   in Mumbai region "ap-south-1a" AZ. assign 
6) Create custom policy to allow full ec2,
   except all ELB actions.   
	
==============================================================
1) Create A policy which restrict user to launch Ec2 instances in Mumbai region

2) Create A policy which Deny Delete objects from Mumbai region S3 buckets.

3) User is allowed to perform all ec2 action in only in VPC123.

4) Create A policy which Deny to create elb in  VPC123.

5) Create A policy which allow to launch only t2.micro,t2.nano instances

6) Create A policy which deny to change iam role of ec2 instance (instanceid i-234456)
7) Create A policy which deny to create route tables in VPC123

8) Create A policy which deny to detach IGW from vpc "VPC123"

9) Create a policy which will not allow "sheshi" i am user to upload the objects
   into s3 bucket i.e "intelliq-mum".

10) Create A policy which allow all ec2 actions except creating snapshots in 
    mumbai region
